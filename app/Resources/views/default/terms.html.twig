                                All prices are subject to availability and can be withdrawn or varied without notice. The price is only guaranteed when paid in full.

Refunds, Changes and Cancellation Fees
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                We are unable to provide a refund to you until we receive the funds from the relevant supplier.  Cancelled bookings will incur charges.  These charges can be up to 100% of the cost of the booking, regardless of whether travel has commenced.  Fees and extra charges will apply where a booking is changed. Fees and extra charges will also apply when tickets or documents are re-issued. Where we incur any liability for a cancellation fee or charge for any booking which you cancel, you agree to indemnify us for the amount of that fee or charge.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You will be required to pay a deposit or deposits when booking. Your consultant will advise you of how much that will be. All deposits are non-refundable.  Final payment is required no later than 6 weeks prior to departure unless otherwise stated. Some airfares or services must be paid in full at the time of booking.Payments by Credit Card

If for any reason any travel service provider is unable to provide the services for which you have contracted, your remedy lies against that provider, and not against Time Holidays Pty Ltd. In the event that payment has been made to Time Holidays Pty Ltd by credit card, you agree that you will not seek to charge back your payment to Time Holidays Pty Ltd.

If you are paying by this method you will need to make the payment at least 5 business days prior to the actual due date. You agree not to stop payment of the cheque even when you cancel a booking.

                                Time Holidays acts as an agent only. We sell various travel related products on behalf of numerous transport, accommodation and other service providers, such as airlines, coach, rail and cruise line operators. Time Holiday’s obligation is to make travel bookings on your behalf and to arrange relevant contracts between you and travel service providers. We have no responsibility for these services nor do we make or give any warranty or representation regarding their standard.  All bookings are made on your behalf subject to the terms and conditions and limitations of liability imposed by these service providers.  Your legal recourse is against the specific provider and not Time Holidays.  If for any reason, any travel service provider is unable to provide the services for which you have contracted your remedy lies against the provider and not with Time Holidays.

Under circumstances where liability cannot be excluded, such liability is limited to the value of the purchased travel arrangements.  We do not accept any liability in contract, tort or otherwise for any injury, damage, loss (including consequential loss), delay, additional expense or inconvenience caused directly or indirectly by force majeure or any other event which is beyond our control and which is not preventable by reasonable diligence on our part.

                                It is your responsibility to ensure that you have valid passports, visas and re-entry permits which meet the requirements of immigration and other government authorities. Any fines, penalties, payments or expenditures incurred as a result of such documents not meeting the requirements of those authorities will be your sole responsibility.  All travelers must have a valid passport for international travel and many countries require at least 6 months validity from the date of return and some countries require a machine-readable passport. If you need information regarding visa and other travel document requirements for your trip please let us know.  We can obtain such information from an external visa advisory service provider on your behalf.  We do not warrant the accuracy of such information and accept no liability for any loss or damage which you may suffer in reliance on it.  If you wish, we can obtain visas for you through this external service and fees will apply.
